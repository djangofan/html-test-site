StaticHTMLTestSite
==================

A static sample HTML site for WebDriver testing.  Site browsing is not enabled; you <br/>
will need to hit the exact URL:  [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001/index.html)

Get up and running with three steps:
<ol>
<li>Download the .zip distribution of this archive. Unzip it anywhere.</li>
<li>Run with Gradle task set "clean copyToLib wrapper compileJava".  There is also a<br/>
   'startWeb' Gradle task if  you choose to use it but it isn't really necessary.</li>
<li>Run the included 'startWeb.bat' directly. (startWeb.sh coming soon)</li>
</ol>
