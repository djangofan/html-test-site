StaticHTMLTestSite
==================

A static sample HTML site for WebDriver testing.  Site browsing is not enabled; you 
will need to hit the exact URL:  http://localhost:8001/index.html

Get up and running with two steps:
- Run with Gradle task set "clean copyToLib wrapper compileJava".  There is also a<br/>
   'startWeb' Gradle task if  you choose to use it but it isn't really necessary.
- Run the included 'startWeb.bat' directly.
